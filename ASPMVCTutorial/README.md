# Learning ASP.NET Core MVC

This is my project from learning ASP.NET Core with the model-view-controller architecture with [this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1DASYd9rk). I did not host this on Azure because I didn't want to spend money on it and hosting it at home was enough for me :)

I used the Vapor CSS from [bootswatches](https://bootswatch.com/) and toastr from [CodeSeven](https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr)
